Practicing and developing ML models for fun

I've performed some ML modelling in my research but have really got more interested in this recently, especially as an aspect of data science.

I've been learning more formally with Kaggle/Udemy and have begun to work on some models for competitions.

Planning on adding to this a lot in the future. 

For now I'm exploring how the competition models on Kaggle work and building slowly from there to unite my previous experience in this new format which should enable me to learn more in the future.

Currently looking for ideas on how to showcase skills. Somethign a bit more more interesting than kaggle competitions?
