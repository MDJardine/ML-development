Practicing and developing ML models for fun

I've perfomed some ML modelling in my reserach but have really got more interested in this recenelty, espcially as an aspect of data science.

I've been learning more formally with Kaggle/Udemy and have begun to work on some models for competitions.

Planning on addign to this a lot in the future.
